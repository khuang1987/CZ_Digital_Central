# Issues Identified in Measure Phase
- Data & Definitions
  - Data sources fragmented, no single source of truth
    - Power BI, Excel, SFC, OEE, MES, email and SharePoint each maintain their own data
    - Field names and definitions are inconsistent, leading to different report results
  - KPI definitions and business rules are non-transparent
    - KPIs and formulas are scattered across scripts, personal Excel files and verbal agreements
    - The same KPI shows different values in different reports, triggering frequent questions and explanations
  - Master data and dimension tables are incomplete and inconsistent
    - Product, process, organization and customer master data are maintained in different systems
    - Missing, duplicated and mixed historical versions cause inconsistent aggregation results
  - Time-related definitions are not aligned (calendar/shifts/time zone/holidays)
    - Different systems handle shifts, cross-day periods and holidays differently
    - Timestamp granularity and meaning are inconsistent, causing systematic deviations in lead time, capacity and utilization KPIs

- Process & Data Quality
  - Lack of data quality rules and monitoring (missing/duplicate/outliers)
    - No unified data quality standards or automated checks
    - Relying on manual eyeballing to detect issues, anomalies are found too late
  - No systematic consistency checks and reconciliation
    - No automated cross-system, cross-level reconciliation and alerts
    - Inconsistent data flows into reports and is hard to detect and trace
  - High proportion of manual input and offline spreadsheets, processes not closed-loop
    - Key data maintained via email, Excel and manual A3 reports
    - Approval and change history are incomplete, making responsibility and history hard to trace

- Reports & Usage
  - Fragmented report and KPI landscape, duplicated solutions
    - Departments build their own reports based on local needs
    - Multiple similar but inconsistent dashboards exist for the same topic
  - Insufficient governance of access control and data security
    - No unified permission model or approval workflow for reports and datasets
    - Risks of over-privileged access, or users bypassing the system due to overly restrictive controls

- Refresh & Operations
  - Report refresh relies on full loads and manual triggers
    - Full refresh is the default, with no robust incremental, rerun or backfill mechanism
    - As data volume grows, refresh becomes slow or fails, creating "report unavailable windows"
  - Configurations are scattered, lacking change audit and rollback
    - Report configurations and query logic are split across scripts, multiple PBIX files and parameter files
    - When numbers change online, it is hard to identify which change caused it, making troubleshooting and rollback difficult
